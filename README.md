# Shell Completions for Gleam

You can learn more about the Gleam programming language
[here](https://gleam.run/).


## Fish Completion

Some caveats:
- It is handwritten, so it may become outdated if Gleam CLI changes
- I may have missed some subcommands and options
- No completion for dynamic stuff (yet): hex packages, dependencies, runnable modules
- It's my first fish completion, so there may be some mistakes

To install save `gleam.fish` in `$XDG_DATA_HOME`
(should default to `~/.config/fish/completions`)
or any other directory in `$fish_complete_path`
